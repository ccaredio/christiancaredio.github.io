Hello and thank you for taking the time to look over my work provided in this portfolio. This portfolio consists of work I have done both at my current position and in my personal time with the goal to showcase my analysis skills. I am currently employed at Mote Marine Laboratory as an Ocean Instrument Specialist where I gather oceanographic data using ocean instruments. Throughout my undergraduate career and my current job, I have found that my passion lies within the data analysis side of the field. I thoroughly enjoy the process of gathering, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data. This led me to taking and completing the Google Data Analyst Certification to further expand my skills and knowledge with data anlysis with the goal to change careerts into the data analyst field. I plan to further expand and improve my skills through personal and professional projects as I look for entry level jobs as a data analyst.
